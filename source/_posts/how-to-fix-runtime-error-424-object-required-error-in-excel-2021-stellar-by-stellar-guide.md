## How to fix runtime error 424 object required error in Excel

The Runtime error 424: Object required occurs when Excel is not able to recognize an object that you are referring to in a VBA code. The object can be a workbook, worksheet, range, variable, class, macro, etc. Some users have also reported that this error occurred when they tried to copy the values of the cells from one workbook to another.

Let’s understand the error through a small scenario. Suppose, I want to check the last field row in a table in a spreadsheet named “First” using the VBA code. To do this, I have added a command button and double-clicked on it and entered the below code in the backend:

Private Sub CommandButton2\_Click()

Dim LRow As Integer

LRow = Worksheets("First").Cells(Rows.Count, 2).End(xlUp).Row

MsgBox ("Last Row " & LRow)

End Sub

![Code On Command Button](https://www.stellarinfo.com/public/image/catalog//article/file-repair/Error424/code-on-commandbutton.jpg)

In this code, _Worksheets("First")_ is a data object. If I mistakenly delete this data object and insert any random name (for example - kanada), then it will not be recognized by Excel. When I run this code, I will get the “Run-time error 424”.

### **2\. Check if the Object is Missing**

 The Runtime error 424 can occur if the object you are referring to as a method is not available or you are using the wrong object in a code. In the below example, you can see that the error occurs when an object named “Employee” is not available in the Project list.

For this, ensure that the 'Always create backup' option is enabled in Excel. You can find it in General Options by clicking on the Tools button in the Save As dialog box. Enabling it will ensure that the Excel backup file is updated with the changes made in a spreadsheet.

## How to Fix the #Value! Error in Excel?

**Summary:** #Value! is a common error that occurs when using formulas in Excel. It can be due to an issue with the cells you are referencing or use of formulas in the wrong type or format. This blog will discuss some cases when this error may occur and the solutions to fix the issue. You’ll also find about an Excel repair software that can help fix the error if it has occurred due to corruption in Excel file.

[![Free Download for Windows](https://www.stellarinfo.com/images/free-download-windows.png)](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/ "Free Download for Windows")

You may experience the #Value! error in Excel when trying to enter invalid data type into the formulas. Sometimes, it appears when a value is not the expected type or when dates are given a text value. This Excel error may occur due to several reasons. However, the exact cause of this error is difficult to find. Below, we will be discussing some cases where you may get this error and the solutions to resolve the issues.

## Case 1: Wrong Argument Data Type in Formulas

Sometimes, Excel throws the “#Value!” error if it recognizes incompatible arguments in the formulas.

For example: The Date function in the sheet expects only numerical values as arguments. In the below image you can see that when the formula’s string value is used in the month (January), it resulted in the #VALUE! error.

![Image of #Value! error in Date Function](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/date-function-error.png)

**Solution**

To fix the issue,

- Double-click the formula to verify the type of arguments.

![Image of Solution to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/verify-type-of-arguments-in-formulas.png)

- Correct the argument in the cell (B2).

![Image of Correcting Argument In Cell to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/correcting-argument-in-the-cell.png)

The formula will work as expected.

## Case 2: Using the Basic Subtraction Formula

Users often experience the #Value! error, when using the basic subtraction formula in Excel.

- Click **OK.**
- Now, open the Excel file and again try to use the formula.

## Case 3: Wrong Text Value

The #Value! error can also occur due to the formula’s wrong value.

For example: If you are using the formula to add values in cells and Excel recognizes the unexpected text value, you may get a #Value error.

![Image of #Value! error in Excel because of Wrong Text Value](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/error-with-wrong-text-value.png)

**Solution**

To fix the issue, you can correct the value or use the SUM function. It is recommended to use functions instead of operations to reduce the errors. In Excel, the formulas with math operators may not able to calculate the text in the cells. The SUM function automatically ignores the text value(er), calculates everything as numbers, and displays the result without the #Value! error.

![Image of Highlighting Arguments Of-Sumfunction to fix #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/highlighting-arguments-of-sumfunction.png)

## Case 4: Blank Space in Cells

You may get the #Value! error if your formula refers to other cells with space or hidden space. Sometimes, spaces that make a cell display blank but actually they are not blank.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Image of #Value! error in Excel because of Blank Space](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/errormessage-with-blank-space.png)

First, check if a cell is blank or not. To do this,

- Select the cell that looks blank.
- Press F2.

![Image of Blank cell Not Showing Space and hence the #Value! error in Excel](https://www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/windows-with-blankcell-not-showing-space.png)

## Case 4: Problem with Network Connection

Many users have reported experiencing errors when using Excel online due to problems with the network connection.

**Solution**

Check your Internet connection and see if it is working properly.  

## Case 5: Wrong Formula Format

If you enter the wrong formula with a missing parenthesis or comma, then Excel can throw the #Value! error. The error can also occur if the application finds a special character within a cell.

**Solution**

Correct the formula and use the ISTEXT function to find the cells with issues.  

## Case 6: Corruption in the Excel File

If none of the above works, then it indicates the Excel file is corrupt. The formulas in the Excel file do not work due to corruption.

**Solution**

You can [use the Open and Repair utility](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/repair-a-corrupted-workbook-153a45f4-6cab-44b1-93ca-801ddcd4ea53) in Excel if you are getting the error due to corruption in Excel file.

![Excel file is corrupt and cannot be opened message](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Excel-file-corruption-message-300x139.png)

Excel File Corruption Message

Also, you don’t have a healthy backup of the Excel file to restore the data? If so, you can try repairing the corrupt file by using a few simple yet effective manual workarounds mentioned below.

## **How to Open a Corrupt Excel File without Backup?**

Following are some manual methods that can help you open a corrupt Excel file:

### **Method 1: Repair Corrupt Excel File**

When attempting to open a corrupt file, Excel automatically starts ‘File Recovery’ mode to repair the file. But, if the recovery mode doesn’t start, try Microsoft Excel’s built-in ‘Open and Repair’ feature to manually repair the file.

To use this feature, perform the following steps:

**Step 1:** Open a **Blank workbook** in Excel, and then click **File > Open**.

**Step 2:** In the **Open** window, browse and select the corrupt file.

**Step 3:** Click the arrow that is beside the **Open** tab, and select **Open and Repair**.

![Open a blank workbook in Excel, navigate to File > Open, choose the corrupt file, and, in the Open window, click the arrow beside the Open tab, selecting Open and Repair for file recovery.](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Open-and-repair.png)

Open and Repair Option

**Step 4:** Implement one of the following:

- Click the **Repair** button. (This is to recover as much data as possible.)
- Click the **Extract Data** button. (This is to recover values and formulas from the Excel file if the repair process fails to recover the entire data.)

Excel Built-in Repair Options

If using [Open and Repair does not work](https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/repaire-for-excel/), move to the next method.

### **Method 2: Disable the Protected View Feature**

Some Excel users have reported that turning off the ‘protected view’ feature in Excel helped them open the corrupt file. You can also try to disable this feature and open the file. To do so, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Open a blank Excel file, click on **File** > **Options**.

**Step 2:** In the **Excel Options** window, select **Trust Center**, and then click **Trust Center Settings**.

![In the Trust Center tab, click on Trust Center Settings...](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Excel-trust-center-settings.png)

Excel Trust Center Settings

**Step 3:** Click **OK.**

Now check if you can open the corrupt file. If not, try implementing the next method.

### **Method 3: Look For Automatically Recovered Excel File**

If you have Excel’s AutoRecover feature enabled, you’ll have access to a copy of the **Excel file corrupted** or lost due to application crash, power outage, or accidental deletion.

**The ‘AutoRecover’** feature saves Excel worksheets at a temporary location after a certain time interval. It saves the worksheets automatically and is turned on by default to reduce the chance of data loss.

Check if you can **[recover corrupted Excel file](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/repair-a-corrupted-workbook-153a45f4-6cab-44b1-93ca-801ddcd4ea53)** by following these steps:

**Step 1:** In Excel, open a **Blank workbook**.

**Step 2:** Go to **File** and click **Options**.

Figure 5 – Excel Options

**Step 3:** In the **Excel Options** dialog box, click **Save**, and then copy the ‘AutoRecover file location’.

![Copy the 'AutoRecover file location' for configuration or backup purposes.](https://cdn-cmlep.nitrocdn.com/DLSjJVyzoVcUgUSBlgyEUoGMDKLbWXQr/assets/images/optimized/rev-2658c43/www.stellarinfo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Autorecover-excel-file.png)

Excel Options Window

**Step 4:** Open File Explorer window and paste the copied AutoRecover file location, and press **Enter**.

**Step 5:** A list of saved Excel files will be displayed. Choose the file you want to recover.


_**TIP:** Use Excel’s AutoBackup feature to reduce chances of data loss, by saving a previous version of your spreadsheet automatically._
